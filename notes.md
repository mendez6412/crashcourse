# Introduction (5-10 minutes)
  - Shannon and Tommy
    - backgrounds
  - Students
    - background with programming

# Running a Python Application
  - Install Atom via https://atom.io/
  - Setting Up
    - command + space --> terminal
    - cd Desktop
    - mkdir number_game
    - cd number_game
    - touch number_game
    - atom .

# Python Basics
  - Python3 Shell
    - Variables (x = 1, x = 'a', etc)
    - Functions (def fancy(x))
      - return
      - print
    - Types (String, Float, Int, Bool, Class Object)
    - Loops (While, For)
    - Other Keywords (and, if, lambda, import)
    - Explain dunder name == dunder main

# Creating the Game
  - We need a secret number
    - import random
    - set secret number variable
    - place in a function
  - Testing
  - We need to get a guess
    - What type does input return?
      - How do we convert that? int()
    - set guess variable
    - place in a function
  - Check guess compared to secret number

# Improving the Game
  - # of Guesses
    - Use while loop with incrementing variable
  - High or Low
    - Have the computer tell you if your guess was high or low
  - You hide a number from the computer
  - OOP
